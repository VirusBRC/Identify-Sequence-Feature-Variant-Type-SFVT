IRD provides pre-computed SNP data for Influenza A sequences grouped by segment number, subtype, and host.  Sequences are aligned and a consensus sequence determined for each group, and the variation from that value has been determined for each position in the sequence. Both IRD and ViPR provide this analysis tool for nucleotide or amino acid sequences selected from database or uploaded by user. (Refer to SFVT_Article.pdf for more detail)
